## Event Overview

The 2025 Statistical Innovation Community Summit convened cross-industry heads and experts of statistical innovation/methodology groups to share operating models, impact strategies, and AI/ML adoption approaches. Representatives from nearly all major pharmaceutical companies participated in this collaborative forum.

## Program Agenda

### Session 1: From Support to Leadership
**Moderators**: Kristine Broglio, Elena Polverejan

#### Key Challenges Identified
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited resources and high workload pressures
- **Impact Demonstration**: Difficulty in clearly demonstrating business value
- **Visibility Issues**: Inconsistent visibility and recognition within organizations
- **Engagement Models**: Optional engagement leading to missed opportunities
- **Attribution Gaps**: Challenges in proper recognition and credit attribution

#### What Leaders Value
Leaders prioritize measurable outcomes including:
- **Business Impact**: Time saved, cost reduction, patients helped, probability of success (PoS) improvements
- **Adoption Outcomes**: Concrete evidence of method implementation and uptake
- **Visibility Metrics**: Governance presence and leadership recognition

#### Successful Operating Models
- **TA Liaisons**: Embedded workflows with regular touchpoints with therapeutic area heads and product leads
- **Optional Consultancy**: Effective where high trust relationships exist
- **Governance Presence**: Prioritizing formal representation in decision-making processes

#### Building Visibility and Culture
- **Co-presentation Strategy**: Present jointly with product and clinical teams
- **Regular Reporting**: Biannual impact reports delivered to R&D leadership
- **Internal Education**: Lunch & Learn sessions and bite-sized educational modules

#### Recognition and Attribution Strategies
- **Early Charter Roles**: Establish clear roles early in complex initiatives
- **Inclusive Governance**: Ensure innovation contributors participate in governance structures
- **Awards and Recognition**: Make innovation statisticians eligible for patents, publications, and organizational awards

### Session 2: Maximizing Impact via Cross-Functional Collaboration
**Moderators**: Binbing Yu, Qinghua Song

#### Early Engagement Strategies
- **Protocol Optimization**: Focus on study design improvements before operational commitments
- **Fit-for-Purpose Science**: Ensure scientific approach matches business objectives
- **Communication**: Use visuals and minimize jargon to create shared understanding

#### Collaboration Structures
- **Department-wide Reviews**: Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) review forums
- **TA/Product Liaisons**: Dedicated representatives for therapeutic areas and products
- **Working Groups**: Specialized teams for payer evidence, biomarkers, and dose optimization with quarterly cross-functional updates

#### Education and Outreach
- **Leadership Workshops**: Design simulations targeted at leadership decision-making
- **Cross-functional Training**: Education programs for non-statisticians
- **Office Hours**: Regular availability for consultation and support
- **External Engagement**: Joint presentations with clinicians and participation in scientific consortia and ASA Biopharm groups

#### Prioritization Framework
- **Portfolio Alignment**: TA-level strategic alignment with business priorities
- **High-Impact Focus**: Concentrate on high-impact assets and resource-constrained programs
- **Pilot Approach**: Start with receptive stakeholders, then standardize successful approaches

#### Recognition Management
- **Charter Documentation**: Prevent visibility loss through clear roles and responsibilities
- **Credit Balance**: Fair attribution between product statisticians and innovation teams
- **Team Culture**: Foster collaborative "team win" mentality

### Session 3: Embracing AI/ML in Statistical Innovation
**Moderators**: Demissie Alemayehu, Li Wang

#### Mindset and Foundations
- **Statistical Grounding**: AI/ML approaches rooted in solid statistical theory
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Adopt validation approaches that maintain human oversight
- **Statistical Strengths**: Leverage statisticians' expertise in uncertainty quantification and decision framing

#### Key Adoption Areas

**Design and Analysis**
- Risk scores for randomization optimization
- Transformer-enhanced Cox models
- Integrated operating characteristics

**Patient Stratification**
- Advanced subgroup identification
- Personalized treatment approaches

**Real-World Evidence (RWE)**
- Digital twins for external control development
- Enhanced observational study designs

**Operational Efficiency**
- Recruitment projections and site feasibility
- Signal and anomaly detection
- Process automation including context-aware coding
- Protocol, SAP, and Clinical Study Report (CSR) drafting under appropriate guardrails

#### Practical Considerations
- **Data Constraints**: Address pharmaceutical industry's unique data scale limitations
- **Domain Expertise**: Leverage domain-structured machine learning approaches
- **Consortium Data**: Promising but constrained by anonymization and standardization requirements
- **Skill Development**: Python proficiency, interpretability skills, prompt engineering, and multi-model benchmarking

#### Validation and Governance
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Use confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and resampling methods where feasible
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of environment and parameters
- **Prototyping**: Begin with user-led prototypes before scaling
- **IT Collaboration**: Scale with IT support while avoiding architecture-first forcing

#### Organizational Integration
- **Strategic Positioning**: Position innovation teams as statistical data science owners in clinical development
- **Training Expansion**: Broaden ML education across teams
- **Cultural Management**: Address pushback (e.g., concerns about AI-generated SAPs) by framing AI as freeing statisticians for higher-order design and decision work

## Community Development and Next Steps

### ASA Biopharm Working Group - Statistical Innovators in Medical Product Development
- **Formalization**: Cross-industry working group proposal reportedly approved with formal listing pending
- **Leadership Structure**: Proposed chair leadership to be confirmed with flat organizational structure encouraging collective contributions
- **Timeline**: Finalization planned before ASA leadership transitions in 2026

### Efficiency+ Working Group (ASA Biopharm)
- **Scope**: End-to-end optimization across design, feasibility, operations, and supply chain
- **Approach**: Iterative modeling across traditional silos
- **Leadership**: Statisticians leading quantitative decision frameworks

## Action Priorities

The summit identified key action items for the statistical innovation community:

1. **Metrics Definition**: Define leadership-valued metrics tied to business impact and organizational visibility

2. **Institutional Models**: Institutionalize therapeutic area liaison models and ensure governance presence for innovation statisticians

3. **Education Scale-up**: Expand training for non-statisticians and conduct leadership workshops with simulated decision-making scenarios

4. **AI/ML Implementation**: Pilot AI/ML use cases with appropriate guardrails and publish internal standards for human-in-the-loop validation, uncertainty quantification, and documentation

5. **Technology Partnership**: Partner with IT on digital data flow initiatives (ICH M11/USDM) and user-led prototypes for specification-to-code automation and design operating characteristics

6. **Community Building**: Complete ASA Biopharm working group establishment, plan 2026 summit and interim sessions, and share case studies and templates across companies

## Key Takeaways

The 2025 summit advanced the statistical innovation community's understanding of:

1. **Leadership Transition**: Moving from support roles to leadership positions within organizations
2. **Cross-functional Integration**: Essential strategies for effective collaboration across pharmaceutical development teams
3. **AI/ML Integration**: Practical approaches for incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning while maintaining statistical rigor
4. **Community Formalization**: Progress toward formal recognition through ASA Biopharm working groups
5. **Measurable Impact**: Importance of defining and tracking metrics that demonstrate business value

## Looking Forward

**2026 Summit**: Planning underway for the next Statistical Innovation Community Summit with interim sessions to maintain momentum and community engagement.
