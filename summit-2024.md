## Welcome and Opening Remarks

**Host**: Kevin Bugin, AVP, Head of Global Regulatory Policy and Intelligence, Amgen

## Session Summary

### Roundtable Session #1: Good Practices Leading to Success
**Moderators**: Chenguang Wang, May Mo

#### Key Insights for Maximizing Impact

To maximize the impact and value of a statistical innovation group within a business:

1. **Understand the business model**
2. **Deliver value to the business**
3. **Be recognized** by the business, statistical field, and regulatory agencies

#### Building Trust and Recognition

- **Trust is essential** for success and collaboration
- While trust grows organically, a **top-down approach** can be more efficient
- Establishing **formal processes** to embed statistical innovation into drug development is crucial

#### Strategic Questions for Innovation Groups

Every statistical innovation group should consider:

- **Who are your stakeholders?** (R&D heads, cross-functional heads, Regulatory, etc.)
- **Who are your partners?** How do you collaborate with each other?
- **Who are your advocates?**

#### Opportunities for Differential Value

Innovation statisticians can offer unique value by:

- Serving as a **central hub** for internal projects across therapeutic areas
- Acting as **point of contact** for external consultants
- Becoming **subject matter experts** in decision-making and statistical topics
- Leading **strategic projects** like developing guidance documents

### Roundtable Session #2: Challenges
**Moderators**: Haoda Fu, Jennifer Schumi

#### Key Challenges Identified

**Early Involvement**
- Many missed opportunities due to lack of involvement from the beginning
- Need for **matrix team concept** or "checkbox" step in protocol development

**Resource Management**
- Heavy workloads and limited resources stretch groups thin
- Innovation statisticians often treated as "fire fighters" with little recognition
- Challenging to establish resource models compared to trial statisticians

**Career Development**
- Career paths require clear definition to attract and retain talent
- Need for mobility between product and innovation roles
- Should not view product and innovation statisticians as separate career paths

**Organizational Positioning**
- Groups must decide their position: consulting team (reactive) vs. lighthouse (proactive)
- Data science integration: statisticians should participate in hiring processes

### Roundtable Session #3: Future of the Statistical Innovation Community
**Moderators**: Satrajit Roychoudhury, Kentaro Takeda

#### Future Focus Areas

Priority topics for statistical innovation groups:

- **Estimands**
- **Dose optimization**
- **Combination trials**
- **External controls**
- **Non-proportional hazards** and crossing survival curves
- **Accelerating R&D cycles**
- **Scientific vs. operational elements** of clinical trials
- **Portfolio decision-making**
- **In silico/simulated trials**

## Looking Forward

**2025 Summit**: Pfizer has graciously offered to host the Statistical Innovation Community Summit in 2025.

## Key Takeaways

The 2024 summit reinforced the critical importance of:

1. **Strategic positioning** of innovation groups within organizations
2. **Early engagement** in drug development processes
3. **Clear career development** paths for innovation statisticians
4. **Cross-functional collaboration** and stakeholder engagement
5. **Formal processes** for embedding innovation in business operations
