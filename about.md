## Vision Statement

The Statistical Innovation Community aims to be the premier forum for advancing
statistical innovation in pharmaceutical research and development. We envision a
future where statistical innovators are recognized as essential contributors to
medical product development, with clear career paths and organizational support.

### Mission

Our mission is to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among statistical
innovators, promoting best practices that accelerate the development of new
medical products for patients while maintaining the highest standards of
scientific rigor.

## Our Story

The Statistical Innovation Community emerged from discussions at the
Regulatory-Industry Statistics Workshop (RISW) 2023, where leaders recognized
the need for a dedicated forum to address the unique challenges and
opportunities facing statistical innovation groups.

### The Need for Innovation

Statistical innovation has become essential in:
- Accelerating medical product development
- Addressing complex trial designs and regulatory requirements
- Implementing cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and AI
- Optimizing drug development portfolios

### Key Challenges Addressed

Our community focuses on overcoming both technical and operational obstacles:

**Technical Challenges:**
- Evaluating new methods through robust simulation studies
- Balancing practicality with methodological novelty
- Educating stakeholders on innovative approaches
- Gaining regulatory acceptance for novel methods

**Operational Challenges:**
- Establishing career paths for innovation statisticians
- Building trust and recognition within organizations
- Developing sustainable resource models
- Creating formal processes for innovation integration

## Community Principles

### 1. Collaborative Partnership
We believe innovation thrives through collaboration between industry, academia, and regulatory agencies.

### 2. Business Value Focus
Innovation groups must understand business needs and deliver measurable value, distinguishing them from purely academic research groups.

### 3. Career Development
We advocate for clear career paths and recognition for statistical innovators within pharmaceutical organizations.

### 4. Knowledge Sharing
Open exchange of best practices, challenges, and solutions benefits the entire community.
