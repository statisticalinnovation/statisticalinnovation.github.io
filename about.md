# About the Statistical Innovation Community Summit

## Vision Statement

The Statistical Innovation Community Summit aims to be the premier forum for advancing statistical innovation in pharmaceutical research and development. We envision a future where statistical innovators are recognized as essential contributors to medical product development, with clear career paths and organizational support.

## Our Story
